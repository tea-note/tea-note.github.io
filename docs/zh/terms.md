Last updated: Jan 1, 2021

Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the Tea Note application (the "Service") operated by Shun Lyu (吕舜). ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.

## Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Shun Lyu (吕舜) cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Shun Lyu (吕舜) customer support team.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Shun Lyu (吕舜) with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Shun Lyu (吕舜) to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Shun Lyu (吕舜) will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

## Free Trial

Shun Lyu (吕舜) may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").

You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.

If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Shun Lyu (吕舜) until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.

At any time and without notice, Shun Lyu (吕舜) reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

## Fee Changes

Shun Lyu (吕舜), in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

Shun Lyu (吕舜) will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
